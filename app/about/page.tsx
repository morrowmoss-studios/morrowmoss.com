            <p className="mb-4">
                MorrowMoss is more than a name. It’s a feeling a place where time folds into itself,
                where stories grow slow and deep, like moss creeping over ancient stone.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                “Morrow” means tomorrow, the promise of what’s to come, the hope that even after decay,
                life will bloom again. “Moss” is soft but relentless, covering ruins with gentle green
                resilience quietly reclaiming space, healing what was broken.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Together, MorrowMoss is a studio born from the spaces between endings and beginnings,
                a sanctuary for stories of transformation, shadow, and light.

                It’s where the forgotten pieces of ourselves find root and grow new branches.
                It’s about honoring the past without being trapped by it, embracing the wildness
                and the wounds, the beauty in slow healing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In every game we craft, we carry that spirit — an invitation to players to wander,
                to feel, to heal, and to become.
